# 🎯 Wireframing: The Architectural Blueprint of Digital Design  

> **Professional Insight**: Wireframing is the UX equivalent of an architect's schematic drawings. It transforms abstract requirements into tangible interface structures before a single line of code is written.  

## 🔍 1. What is Wireframing?  
**Wireframing** is the practice of creating low-detail visual representations (*wireframes*) that map:  
- **Structural layout** of UI components  
- **User flow** between screens  
- **Content hierarchy** and prioritization  
- **Functionality** without visual styling  

### **Industry Significance**  
| Phase | Impact |  
|-------|--------|  
| **Discovery** | Identifies usability gaps early (saves 40% dev time) |  
| **Development** | Serves as single source of truth for engineers |  
| **Stakeholder Alignment** | Prevents misinterpretation of requirements |
